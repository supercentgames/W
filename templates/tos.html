<br> <br> 
<h4><b><u>9. MONITORING USE OF SERVICES</h4></b></u>
We have no obligation to monitor the Services for inappropriate or illegal User Content or the conduct of other players. We also are not responsible for information, materials, products, or services provided by other players (for instance, in their profiles) and User Content is not approved by us. However, if someone is violating these Terms or misusing the Services, please let us know by contacting us at support@supercentgames (dot) com or supercentgames@gmail (dot) com
<br> <br> 
While we have no obligation to monitor the Services, we have the right, in our sole discretion, to monitor, record, or store your interactions with the Services or your communications with Supercent or other player when you are using the Services (including without limitation your communications through in-game text or video chat). For more information, see our Privacy Policy. We may also, at our discretion, choose to edit, refuse to post, or remove any User Content.

<br> <br> 
<h4><b><u>10. FEES AND PURCHASE TERMS</h4></b></u>
We provide a service in the form of access to games, Virtual Items, and our other Services. In the Services you may use “real world” money to obtain a limited license and right to use Virtual Items and/or other goods or services.
<br> <br> 
<b>How it Works</b>
<br> <br> 
You get a limited license and right to use Virtual Items by visiting the purchase page in one of our games or Services and providing billing authorization through the platform on which you are playing (e.g., Facebook, Apple, Google).
<br> <br> 
When you purchase Virtual Items in our games on platforms such as Facebook, Apple, or Google, Supercent is not a party to the transaction and your purchase will be governed by the third-party platform’s payment terms and conditions. Please review the platform’s terms of service for additional information. You can also contact our Billing Support team as described below for questions concerning refunds of purchases made through Facebook or Google.
<br> <br> 
You understand that while you may “earn,” “buy,” or “purchase” Virtual Items in our Services, you do not legally “own” the Virtual Items and the amounts of any Virtual Item do not refer to any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent. Any “virtual currency” balance shown in your Account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your limited license.
<br> <br> 
ALL SALES ARE FINAL: YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SUPERCENT IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY, OR WHETHER YOU MADE A PAYMENT THROUGH PLATFORM SUCH AS APPLE, GOOGLE, FACEBOOK, OR ANY OTHER SITES OR PLATFORMS WHERE WE OFFER OUR SERVICES.
<br> <br> 
PURCHASES TO ACQUIRE A LIMITED LICENSE AND RIGHT TO USE VIRTUAL ITEMS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW.
<br> <br> 
 

<b>Additional Payment Terms</b>
<br>  
When you provide credit card information to us, you represent that you are the authorized user of the credit card that is used to pay the subscription or other fees.
<br> <br> 
We will not be liable for any errors on billing statements issued to you by your carrier. You accept full responsibility for confirming that the phone or other device manufacturer, phone or other device model, and carrier are supported and that the phone or other device is compatible to the products or services purchased, downloaded or otherwise obtained by you through the Services. Although we will make commercially reasonable efforts to help you obtain the proper software for your telephone, device or platform, we will not be liable or responsible for any Purchaser Errors.
<br> <br> 
You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using an Account registered to you. Supercent may revise the pricing for the goods and services it licenses to you through the Services at any time.
<br> <br> 
For orders to obtain a limited license and right to use Virtual Items, by clicking the purchase/order button on the purchase window or page you:
<br> <br> 
agree that we will supply the Virtual Items to you as soon as we have accepted your order; and
<br> <br> 
if you reside in the European Union (the “EU”), you acknowledge that you will therefore no longer have the right to cancel under the EU’s Consumer Rights Directive (as implemented by the law of the country where you are located) once we start to supply the Virtual Item.

<h4><b><u>14. FEEDBACK AND UNSOLICITED IDEAS</h4></b></u>
We are pleased to hear from our customers and welcome their comments regarding our Services. Unfortunately, however, long-standing company policy does not allow us to accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions or materials other than those it has specifically requested. We hope you will understand that it is the intent of this policy to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by our professional staff might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work. Accordingly, we must, regretfully, ask that you do not send us any original creative materials such as game ideas or original artwork. While we do value your feedback on our services and products, we request that you be specific in your comments on those services and products, and not submit any creative ideas, suggestions or materials. If, despite our request that you not send us any other creative materials, you send us creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, concepts or other information (collectively, the "Unsolicited Submissions"), the Unsolicited Submissions shall be deemed, and shall remain, the property of Supercent. None of the Unsolicited Submissions shall be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of Supercent, and we shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Unsolicited Submissions. Without limitation of the foregoing, we shall exclusively own all now known or hereafter existing rights to the Unsolicited Submissions of every kind and nature, in perpetuity, throughout the universe and shall be entitled to unrestricted use of the Unsolicited Submissions for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to the provider of the Unsolicited Submissions. You waive any and all moral rights in any such Unsolicited Submissions as well as any claim to a right of credit or approval. The foregoing shall also apply to any creative submissions you make at our specific request, unless otherwise agreed in writing.

Rarely, we may request your feedback on certain features through a promotion or our customer insights program. You are not obliged to respond to our request. Any feedback you provide is deemed to be non-confidential and non-proprietary. Supercent shall be free to use such information on an unrestricted basis, without any compensation to you or any third party.
