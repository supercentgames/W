This staff may be engaged in, among other things, (i) the processing of transactions and your payment details, or (ii) the provision of support services. When we transfer your personal information internationally we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is treated securely, lawfully, and in the manner we describe here.

<br><br>
Participating European countries’ residents should direct any questions, concerns or complaints regarding Supercent’s handling of personal information by sending an email to support@supercentgames (dot) com;
<br><br>
We will attempt to answer your questions and satisfy your concerns in a timely and complete manner.

<br><br>
<b>European Countries’ Users’ Rights</b>
<br><br>

<br><br>
If we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.

<br><br>
<b>Opt-out of targeted advertising.</b>
<br><br>
If you do not want to receive behavioral in-application advertisements from third parties that relate to your interests on your mobile device, you may adjust the ad tracking settings on your device (such as turning on “Limit Ad Tracking”). You can reset your Advertising Identifier and depending on your device, select to opt out of interest-based ads (Android) or turn on the Limit Ad Tracking setting (iOS). Further, depending on the platform provider (such as Apple or Google), you may be able to download apps, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s “AppChoices” app, that offer to provide you with control regarding the collection and use of cross-app data for behavioral advertising.
<br><br>
All of the opt-out tools described in this subsection are provided by third parties, not by Supercent. Supercent does not control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools.
<br><br>
Please note that you may still receive third-party advertisements in Supercent’s Services after using these opt-out tools, but the advertising you see may be less relevant to your interests.
<br><br>
You can opt-out of interest-based advertising on mobile applications by checking the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and selecting "limit ad tracking" (Apple iOS) or "opt-out of interest-based ads" (Android).

<br><br>
Please note that game functionality, Services and features can be affected by your actions. Some of your information and its processing is mandatory for Supercent to provide the Services.
<br><br>
Your actions can oblige Supercent to stop providing the Services. When the conditions below apply, your game might get reset:
<br><br>
If you ask for the modification of this mandatory information, we may not be able to continue to link the game or game Services to you.
<br><br>
If you request limitations to processing that are mandatory for Supercent, or you object to such processing (in which case, we may not be able to provide you with the game or game Services).
<br><br>
If you withdraw your consent or ask for the deletion of your information.
<br><br>
If you withdraw your consent or ask for the deletion of your information, we will not use or process your information anymore but we will store it to answer regulatory or police requests. We also reserve the right to retain an archive of such information for a commercially reasonable time to ensure that its deletion does not affect the integrity of our data; and we further reserve the right to retain an anonymous version of such information.
<br><br>
If you are a parent of a child who is under 13 years of age (or under another age specified by applicable regulations) and believe your child has provided us with information, please contact us by sending an email to support@supercentgames (dot) com and we will delete the information from our system.

Our team will look into your request and will answer you within one month, unless your request requires further investigation. You’ll be specifically informed if that is the case.
<br><br>
We remind European users that they have a right to lodge a complaint with a European Data Protection Supervisor.
<br><br>
Note: European users can also manage personal information associated with their Supercent player profile in certain games, by visiting the “settings” or “profile” page in that game. If due to some unforeseen circumstances, you are not able to see these options then European users can also contact us by sending an email to support@supercentgames (dot) com.
<br><br>
Ad identifiers, cookies and similar technologies
<br><br>
Like most online services, we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies to provide and personalize the Service, analyze use, target advertisements and prevent fraud. You can disable cookies in your browser settings, but some parts of the Service may then not function properly.
<br><br>
<b>California Online Privacy Protection Act Notice</b>
<br>
At this time, there is no general agreement on how companies like Supercent should interpret Do Not Track signals. Supercent does not currently respond to Do Not Track signals, whether that signal is received on a computer or on a mobile device.
<br><br>
<b><u>HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR DATA</u></b>
<br><br>
<b>Security Safeguards.</b>
<br> 
We have implemented security measures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorised access, maintain data security, and correctly use the personal information collected through the Services.
<br><br>
We take, and force applicable third parties to take, reasonable precautions to protect your personal information against loss, misuse, unauthorised disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, please remember that no transmission of data over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information and do not assume any responsibility for the unauthorised use of, or access to, your information that is under our control. We cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information while it is being transmitted to our Service. Any transmission is at your own risk. If you have questions about the security of our websites, please contact us by sending an email to support@supercentgames (dot) com.
<br><br>
<b>Data retention.</b>
<br>
How long we retain your personal information depends on why we collected it and how we use it, but we will not retain your personal information for longer than is necessary for our business purposes or for legal requirements. In most cases, we retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you the Service. We will for example periodically de-identify unused game accounts and we regularly review and de-identify unnecessary data.
<br><br>
Note that if you ask us to remove your personal data, we will retain your data as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We want to inform you that a longer retention period could be required to resolve disputes, or answer regulatory or police requests. In such cases, the collected information will be used and stored until the request is closed.
<br><br>
We will take reasonable measures to delete your personal information if you delete your account. However, you acknowledge that we may retain some information after you have closed, or we have deleted, your account with us where necessary to enable us to meet our legal obligations or to exercise, defend, or establish our rights. We also reserve the right to retain an archive of such information for a commercially reasonable time to ensure that its deletion does not affect the integrity of our data; and we further reserve the right to retain an anonymous version of such information. Once your account is deleted or terminated, after a period of time, your data may be anonymized and aggregated, and then may be held by us as long as necessary for us to provide our Services effectively, but our use of the anonymized data will be solely to prevent players from tricking the Service and prevent them from taking any undue advantage which affects the commercial success of our Service. Pseudonymization or Anonymization on the data will be done to prevent fraud or potentially illegal activities, and to enforce our Terms of Service (http://www.supercentgames.com/Terms-Of-Services/)
<br><br>
<b>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</b>
<br>
Generally speaking, most of our Services are not intended for children under the age of 13 (or under 16 for children located in the European Countries) (collectively, “Children”). Children are not permitted to use these Services, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from Children.
<br><br>
We encourage parents to instruct their children about privacy and the way they use their information on the Internet. Children should never disclose their name, address or phone number, or any personal information, without their parents’ prior permission.
<br><br>
We consider a user to be a child if they are under the age of 13, unless more stringent regulation applies in their country of residence. In EU countries, users under the age of 16 are considered children, unless the data protection regulation of their country of residence specifies another age.
<br><br>
We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data about or direct or target interest-based advertising to anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to use our Services. If you are under 13, please do not send any data about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under the age of 13 may provide any personal data. If we learn that we have collected personal data about a child under age 13, we will delete that data as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any data from or about a child under the age of 13, please contact us by sending an email to support@supercentgames (dot) com.
